We will format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n\nFrom the provided text:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" is an event.\n- \"Future Directions\" is an event.\n- \"issues related to interpretability and explainability\" is not explicitly mentioned as an entity, but it can be considered a description of the challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks.\n\nIdentified entities:\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.\n\nFrom the identified entities in step 1, we need to find pairs of entities that are related. For example:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" and \"Future Directions\" are related because the future directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks.\n- There is no explicit relationship between any two entities mentioned in the text.\n\nIdentified relationships:\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n\n### Step 3: Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.\n\nCombine the identified entities and relationships into a single list, using **##** as the delimiter:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n\n### Step 4: Output <|COMPLETE|>\n\nThe final output is:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 724, "prompt_tokens": 1988, "total_tokens": 2712, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
