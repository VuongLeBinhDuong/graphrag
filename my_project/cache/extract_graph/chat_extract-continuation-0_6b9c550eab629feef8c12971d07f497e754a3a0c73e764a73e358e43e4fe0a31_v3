Techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction are common in this category. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, focuses on training models to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding or penalizing them based on the actions taken. This approach is particularly useful in environments where the decision-making process is complex, such as robotics and game playing.\n\nApplications of Machine Learning\nMachine learning has a wide array of applications across different domains. In healthcare, it is used for predictive diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery. Financial services leverage machine learning for fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading. In the realm of e-commerce, recommendation systems powered by ML algorithms enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products. Additionally, machine learning plays a critical role in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as speech recognition, language translation, and sentiment analysis. Autonomous vehicles, powered by sophisticated ML models, are becoming increasingly prevalent, showcasing the transformative potential of machine learning in transportation.\n\nChallenges and Limitations\nDespite its numerous advantages, machine learning faces several challenges and limitations. One significant issue is the quality and quantity of data available for training. High-quality, large datasets are crucial for developing accurate and reliable models, but such data can be difficult to obtain. Another challenge is the interpretability of models, especially those that are highly complex like deep neural networks. These models often act as \"black boxes,\" making it\n\"\"\"\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store entities\nentities = []\n\n# Loop through each entity type\nfor entity_type in entity_types:\n    #
