We will format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n\nFrom the provided text:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" is an event.\n- \"Future Directions\" is an event.\n- \"issues related to interpretability and explainability\" is not explicitly mentioned as an entity, but it can be considered a description of the challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks.\n\nIdentified entities:\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.\n\nFrom the identified entities in step 1, we need to find pairs of entities that are related. For example:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" and \"Future Directions\" are related because the future directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks.\n- There is no explicit relationship between any two entities mentioned in the text.\n\nIdentified relationships:\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n\n### Step 3: Identify additional entities that match the previously extracted types.\n\nUpon re-examining the text, we can identify additional entities:\n\n- \"AI\" is not explicitly mentioned as an entity, but it can be considered a description of the field related to Graph Neural Networks.\n- \"machine learning paradigms\" is not explicitly mentioned as an entity, but it can be considered a description of the techniques used in conjunction with Graph Neural Networks.\n\nHowever, we also find:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" matches the type \"EVENT\".\n- \"Future Directions\" matches the type \"EVENT\".\n\nAdditionally, we identify entities that match the previously extracted types:\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for processing graph-structured data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Future Directions is the title of a section discussing the future of Graph Neural Networks)\n\n### Step 4: Identify additional relationships between entities.\n\nUpon re-examining the text, we can identify additional relationships:\n\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" and \"AI\" are related because Graph Neural Networks are used in AI.\n- \"Graph Neural Networks\" and \"machine learning paradigms\" are related because Graph Neural Networks are used in conjunction with machine learning paradigms.\n\nHowever, we also find that the previously identified relationship is still valid:\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>FUTURE DIRECTIONS<|>The Future Directions section discusses the future of Graph Neural Networks<|>8)\n\n### Step 5: Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.\n\nCombine the identified entities and relationships into a single list, using **##** as the delimiter:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS<|>EVENT<|>Graph Neural Networks are a type of neural network used for
