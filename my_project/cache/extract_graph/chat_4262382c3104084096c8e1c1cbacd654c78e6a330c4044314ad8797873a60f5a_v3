We will format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n\nFrom the provided text:\n\n- \"CNNs\" refers to Convolutional Neural Networks, which is an organization.\n- \"researchers\" refers to a group of people working on CNNs, so it's a person.\n- \"MobileNets\" and \"EfficientNets\" are organizations (architectures).\n- \"neural architecture search (NAS)\" is not an entity but a concept related to the development of more efficient architectures.\n- \"RNNs\" refers to Recurrent Neural Networks, which is an organization.\n- \"transformers\" refer to a type of neural network, so it's an organization.\n- \"genomics,\" \"climate science,\" and \"art generation\" are fields or areas where CNNs are applied, but they're not entities in this context. However, we can consider them as events related to the application of CNNs.\n\nHere are the identified entities:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>CNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Convolutional Neural Networks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>PERSON<|>Group of people working on CNNs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOBILENETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Efficient architecture for reducing computational complexity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EFFICIENTNETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Efficient architecture for reducing computational complexity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RNN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recurrent Neural Networks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Type of neural network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENOMICS<|>EVENT<|>Field where CNNs are applied for analyzing genetic data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE SCIENCE<|>EVENT<|>Field where CNNs are applied for climate modeling and prediction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ART GENERATION<|>EVENT<|>Field where CNNs are applied for generating art)\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.\n\nFrom the identified entities, we can establish relationships between them based on their descriptions.
