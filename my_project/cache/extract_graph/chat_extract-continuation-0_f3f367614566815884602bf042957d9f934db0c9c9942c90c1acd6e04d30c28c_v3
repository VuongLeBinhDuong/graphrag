We will use the following format for each entity: (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\nFrom the text:\n\n* \"models\" is not a specific model, but rather a general term referring to machine learning models.\n* \"transformers\" are a type of neural network architecture.\n* \"convolutional networks\" are another type of neural network architecture.\n* \"time-series forecasting\", \"healthcare\", and \"finance\" are domains where transformers can be applied.\n* \"AI\" is an abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence, which is related to machine learning models.\n* \"machine learning\" is a subfield of AI that involves training models on data.\n\nWe will identify the following entities:\n\n1. (\"entity\"<|>TRANSFORMERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transformers are a type of neural network architecture)\n2.
