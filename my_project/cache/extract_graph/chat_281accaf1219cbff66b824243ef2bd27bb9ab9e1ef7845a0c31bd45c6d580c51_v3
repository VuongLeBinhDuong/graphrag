We will format each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>).\n\nFrom the text: \"s with other neural network types, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, can lead to more powerful hybrid models capable of handling diverse data types and tasks. Additionally, the application of CNNs is expanding into new fields such as genomics, climate science, and even art generation, demonstrating their versatility. Efforts to improve the interpretability of CNNs, such as developing techniques for visualizing and understanding the learned filters and feature maps, are also crucial for building trust and transparency.
