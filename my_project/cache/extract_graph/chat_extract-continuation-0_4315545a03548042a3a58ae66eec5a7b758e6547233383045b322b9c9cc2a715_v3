entity_name: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n  - entity_type: ORGANIZATION\n  - entity_description: Artificial intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.\n\n- **Entity 2:** \"algorithms\"\n  - entity_name: ALGORITHMS\n  - entity_type: EVENT\n  - entity_description: Algorithms are a set of instructions used to solve problems or make decisions in machine learning models.\n\n- **Entity 3:** \"models\"\n  - entity_name: MODELS\n  - entity_type: ORGANIZATION\n  - entity_description: Models in machine learning refer to the algorithms and statistical models used to enable machines to learn from data.\n\n- **Entity 4:** \"quantum computing\"\n  - entity_name: QUANTUM COMPUTING\n  - entity_type: PERSON\n  - entity_description: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations on data.\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.\n\n- **Relationship 1:** (\"machine learning\", \"algorithms\")\n  -
