These models are designed to process data with grid-like topology, such as images and videos, by scanning the input data in both spatial and depth dimensions.\n\nOne key characteristic of CNNS is their inherent focus on local features. This means that they tend to concentrate on specific details within an image or video rather than understanding the broader context. As a result, CNNS can sometimes struggle with grasping global context, which may lead to limitations in certain applications where contextual understanding is crucial.\n\nDespite these potential limitations, traditional convolutional neural networks have been widely employed for various deep learning tasks due to their effectiveness in processing visual data. Their architecture allows them to efficiently extract relevant features from input data, making them a popular choice for image and video classification, object detection, segmentation, and other related applications.\n\nIn summary, CNNS are powerful tools for deep learning tasks, particularly those involving visual data. However, their focus on local features can sometimes hinder their ability to understand global context, which is an essential aspect of certain applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
