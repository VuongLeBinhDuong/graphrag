This includes complex cognitive functions such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.\n\nThe broader field of AI research involves the exploration of various subfields, with machine learning being one of its key components. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed for each task. By analyzing vast amounts of data, machines can develop predictive models and improve their performance over time.\n\nIn essence, AI represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of computer systems, allowing them to simulate human-like intelligence and tackle complex problems that were previously unsolvable or required extensive manual intervention. As research continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI, its applications are expanding into various domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and education.\n\nThe development of AI has far-reaching implications for numerous industries and aspects of society, making it a critical area of study and innovation in the modern era.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null, "reasoning_content": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}}}
